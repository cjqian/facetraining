### report.pdf
This is the final paper!

### stats_output
This directory contains the log files used to generate results. Includes metadata and specifics regarding results of each experiment, including who was disguised, revealed, etc.

### scripts
Various scripts (not maintained, cleaned, etc.) used to generate results. Evaluation generates the log files and compares datasets, clean filters directories with insufficient amounts of images for cross-reference, and noise generates different kinds of noise (Poisson, Gaussian) for new directories.

### noise output
The actual image files used aren't here because the size of the directories is quite large. If you'd like them, you can either use our noise scripts or contact me.
